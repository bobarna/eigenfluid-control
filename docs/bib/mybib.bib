abstract = {We present a model-reduced variational Eulerian integrator for
            incompressible fluids, which combines the efficiency gains of
            dimension reduction, the qualitative robustness of coarse spatial
            and temporal resolutions of geometric integrators, and the
            simplicity of sub-grid accurate boundary conditions on regular grids
            to deal with arbitrarily-shaped domains. At the core of our
            contributions is a functional map approach to fluid simulation for
            which scalar- and vector-valued eigenfunctions of the Laplacian
            operator can be easily used as reduced bases. Using a variational
            integrator in time to preserve liveliness and a simple, yet accurate
            embedding of the fluid domain onto a Cartesian grid, our
            model-reduced fluid simulator can achieve realistic animations in
            significantly less computational time than full-scale
            non-dissipative methods but without the numerical viscosity from
            which current reduced methods suffer. We also demonstrate the
            versatility of our approach by showing how it easily extends to
            magnetohydrodynamics and turbulence modeling in 2D, 3D and curved
            domains.},

abstract = {We propose an end-to-end trained neural network architecture to robustly predict the complex dynamics of fluid flows with high temporal stability. We focus on single-phase smoke simulations in 2D and 3D based on the incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, which are relevant for a wide range of practical problems. To achieve stable predictions for long-term flow sequences with linear execution times, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained for spatial compression in combination with a temporal prediction network that consists of stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. Our core contribution is a novel latent space subdivision (LSS) to separate the respective input quantities into individual parts of the encoded latent space domain. As a result, this allows to distinctively alter the encoded quantities without interfering with the remaining latent space values and hence maximizes external control. By selectively overwriting parts of the predicted latent space points, our proposed method is capable to robustly predict long-term sequences of complex physics problems, like the flow of fluids. In addition, we highlight the benefits of a recurrent training on the latent space creation, which is performed by the spatial compression network. Furthermore, we thoroughly evaluate and discuss several different components of our method.},

abstract = {Animating fluids like water, smoke, and fire by physics-based
            simulation is increasingly important in visual effects and is
            starting to make an impact in real-time games. This course goes from
            the basics of 3D fluid flow to the state of the art in graphics. We
            will begin with an intuitive explanation of the important concepts
            in fluid simulation, and as we progress demonstrate how to implement
            an effective smoke and water simulation system, complete with
            irregular curved boundaries and surface tension. The last half of
            the course will cover advanced topics such as fire and explosions,
            adaptive grid methods, real-time-capable algorithms together with
            the latest technology in hardware acceleration, and non-Newtonian
            fluids like sand. Intuition and implementation details will be
            underscored throughout.},

abstract = {The Laplacian Eigenfunction method for fluid simulation, which we refer to as Eigenfluids, introduced an elegant new way to capture intricate fluid flows with near-zero viscosity. However, the approach does not scale well, as the memory cost grows prohibitively with the number of eigenfunctions. The method also lacks generality, because the dynamics are constrained to a closed box with Dirichlet boundaries, while open, Neumann boundaries are also needed in most practical scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a set of analytic eigenfunctions that supports uniform Neumann and Dirichlet conditions along each domain boundary, and show that by carefully applying the discrete sine and cosine transforms, the storage costs of the eigenfunctions can be made completely negligible. The resulting algorithm is both faster and more memory-efficient than previous approaches, and able to achieve lower viscosities than similar pseudo-spectral methods. We are able to surpass the scalability of the original Laplacian Eigenfunction approach by over two orders of magnitude when simulating rectangular domains. Finally, we show that the formulation allows forward scattering to be directed in a way that is not possible with any other method.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm for the simulation of incompressible fluid phenomena that is computationally efficient and leads to visually convincing simulations with far fewer degrees of freedom than existing approaches. Rather than using an Eulerian grid or Lagrangian elements, we represent vorticity and velocity using a basis of global functions defined over the entire simulation domain. We show that choosing Laplacian eigenfunctions for this basis provides benefits, including correspondence with spatial scales of vorticity and precise energy control at each scale. We perform Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes equations to derive a time evolution equation in the space of basis coefficients. Our method admits closed-form solutions on simple domains but can also be implemented efficiently on arbitrary meshes.},
