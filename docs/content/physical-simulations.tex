\chapter{Physical Simulations}
Modeling the world around us is a longstanding problem of science. For many
physical processes, model equations exist, describing how a given system evolves
through time. From weather and climate forecasts (\cite{stocker2014climate})
over quantum physics (\cite{QuantumSim}), to the control of plasma fusion
(\cite{PlasmaControl}), or optimizing the shape of
vehicles (\cite{OptimizationCFD}), it has become an integral part of engineering
applications to use numerical methods to derive solutions from model equations.

In this section, we build up an understanding of modeling physical phenomena
with \acfp{PDE}. We also introduce the notion of \acf{DP} after a brief
introduction to classical numerical methods.
