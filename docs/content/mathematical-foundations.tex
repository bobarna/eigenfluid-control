\chapter{Mathematical Foundations}
\label{sec:mathematicalFoundations}
This chapter gives a short overview of the mathematical foundations for the
techniques we discuss later on, while also establishing the notation used in
later sections.

In the following,
\begin{equation*}
    \vb{i} = \mqty( 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 )\quad
    \vb{j} = \mqty( 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 )\quad
    \vb{k} = \mqty( 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 )
\end{equation*}
will denote the canonical basis vectors.

\section{Basic Notation}

$\vb{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is considered a column-matrix, i.e. $\mathbb{R}^n
= \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}$. This also means that $\vb{x}^T$ (the transpose of
$\vb{x}$) is a row-matrix.

We denote the scalar components of a vector $\vb{x}\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ $(x_1,
x_2, \dots, x_n)^T$. When $\vb{x}$ denotes a position in 3D or 2D space, we also
use $\vb{x} = (x,y,z)^T$, and $\vb{x} = (x,y)^T$, respectively.

Bold uppercase letters denote matrices: $\vb{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$, and
its elements are indexed with $\vb{A}_{i,j}$

A function $f(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ is a scalar-valued function $\mathbb{R}^n \to
\mathbb{R}$.  When $\vb{f}: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ is a vector field, we
will denote it as 

$$\vb{f}(\vb{x}) = \vb{f}(x_1,\dots, x_n)=
(f_1(\vb{x}), \dots, f_m(\vb{x}))^T$$

In keeping with the conventions of fluid mechanics literature, we use the letter
$\vb{u}$ to denote the velocity of a fluid. It is hard to say where this
notation came from, but it fits another convention to call the three components
of 3D velocity $(u, v, w)^T$ (dropping $w$ for the 2D case).

\section{Multivariable Calculus}
\subsection*{Gradient}
The gradient $\grad$ is a generalization of the derivative to multiple
dimensions. The symbol $\grad$ is called \textit{nabla}, and typically denotes
taking partial derivatives along all spatial dimensions. 

In three dimensions, 
$$\grad f(x,y,z) = \left(\pdv{f}{x}, \pdv{f}{y}, \pdv{f}{z}\right),$$ 
and in two dimensions,
$$\grad f(x,y) = \left(\pdv{f}{x}, \pdv{f}{y}\right).$$

It can be helpful to think of the gradient operator as a symbolic
vector, e.g. in three dimensions:
$$\grad = \left(\pdv{x}, \pdv{y}, \pdv{z}\right).$$ 

We can also take gradient of vector-valued functions, which results in a matrix.
When $\vb{f}(x_1,\dots x_n) = (f_1, \dots, f_n)^T$, i.e. $\vb{f}: \mathbb{R}^n \to
\mathbb{R}^n$, mapping the $n$ dimensional Euclidean space onto itself, it is
often called the \textit{Jacobian (matrix)} of $\vb{f}$:

$$\grad \vb{f} = \mqty[\grad{f_1}\\\grad{f_2}\\\vdots\\\grad f_n]^T = 
\mqty[
\pdv{f_1}{x_1} & \pdv{f_1}{x_2} & \dots & \pdv{f_1}{x_n}\\
\pdv{f_2}{x_1} & \pdv{f_2}{x_2} & \dots & \pdv{f_2}{x_n}\\
\vdots         &                & \ddots & \vdots \\
\pdv{f_n}{x_1} & \pdv{f_n}{x_2} & \dots & \pdv{f_n}{x_n}
].$$

\subsection*{Divergence}
The divergence operator measures how much the values of a vector field are
converging or diverging at any point in space. In three dimensions:

$$\div{\vb{u}(x,y,z)} = \div(u(\vb{x}), v(\vb{x}), w(\vb{x}))^T = 
\pdv{u}{x}+\pdv{v}{y}+\pdv{w}{z}.$$

Note that the input is a vector, and the output is a scalar, i.e. $\vb{u}:
\mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3, \div{\vb{u}}: \mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}$).
Heuristically, in the case of a fluid velocity field $\vb{u}$, this translates
to a measure of whether a given point acts as a source, or a sink, i.e. whether
particles are created or lost in that infinitesimal region. (Later on, we will
come back to the notion of a divergence-free fluid.)

\subsection*{Curl}
The curl operator measures how much a vector field is rotating around any point. 
In three dimensions, it is given by the vector
$$\curl{\vb{u}(x,y,z) = 
    \mqty(\pdv*{x} \\ \pdv*{y} \\ \pdv*{z}) \cross 
    \mqty(u(x,y,z) \\ v(x,y,z) \\ w(x,y,z))
= \mqty|
    \vb{i}   & \vb{j}   & \vb{k}   \\
    \pdv*{x} & \pdv*{y} & \pdv*{z} \\
    u        & v        & w
|} = \mqty(
\pdv*{w}{y} - \pdv*{v}{z} \\
\pdv*{u}{z} - \pdv*{w}{x} \\
\pdv*{v}{x} - \pdv*{u}{y}
).$$

We reduce this formula to two dimensions by taking the third component of
the expression above, as if we were looking at the three-dimensional vector
field $(u,v,0)$. Thus, the two-dimensional curl is a scalar:
$$\curl{\vb{u}(x,y)} = 
    \mqty(\pdv*{x} \\ \pdv*{y}) \cross 
    \mqty(u(x,y) \\ v(x,y))
    = \pdv{v}{x} - \pdv{u}{y}.$$

\subsection*{Material Derivative}
For a velocity $\vb{u}(t,x,y,z) = \mqty(u \\ v \\ w)$, 
we define the material derivative as 
$$\dv{\vb{u}}{t} = \pdv{\vb{u}}{t} + \qty(\vb{u}\vdot\grad)\vb{u} ,$$

a special case of the total derivative. As $x, y, z$ describe the spatial
position of a particle traveling through space over time, they depend on time
$t$ themselves (i.e.  $\vb{u}(t, x(t), y(t), z(t))$). Utilizing the chain rule,
we can arrive on the above definition by taking the total derivative of
$\vb{u}(t, x(t), y(t), z(t))$, and rearranging the terms:

\begin{alignat*}{2}
    \dv{\vb{u}}{t} &= \pdv{\vb{u}}{t}\dv{t}{t} 
                    + \pdv{\vb{u}}{x}\dv{x}{t} 
                    + \pdv{\vb{u}}{y}\dv{y}{t} 
                    + \pdv{\vb{u}}{z}\dv{z}{t} \\
                    &= \pdv{\vb{u}}{t} 1 \quad
                    + \pdv{\vb{u}}{x} u \quad
                    + \pdv{\vb{u}}{y} v \quad
                    + \pdv{\vb{u}}{z} w \\
                    &= \pdv{\vb{u}}{t} 1 \quad
                    + u \pdv{\vb{u}}{x} \quad
                    + v \pdv{\vb{u}}{y} \quad
                    + w \pdv{\vb{u}}{z} \\
                    &= \pdv{\vb{u}}{t} +
                    \qty(
                        \vb{u}
                        \vdot
                        \left[ \pdv{x}, \pdv{y}, \pdv{z} \right]
                    ) \vdot \vb{u} \\
                    &= \pdv{\vb{u}}{t}
                    + \qty(\vb{u}\vdot\grad)\vdot\vb{u}.
\end{alignat*}

\subsection*{Laplacian}
The Laplacian operator defined as the divergence of the gradient of a scalar
function $f$. In general, for $f(\vb{x}): \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, it is
given by

    $$\Delta f = \grad^2{f} = \grad \vdot \grad f = \sum_{i=1}^n
\pdv[2]{f}{x_i}.$$

In three dimensions, this reduces to 
$$\grad \vdot \grad f = \pdv[2]{f}{x} + \pdv[2]{f}{y} + \pdv[2]{f}{z},$$

and in two dimensions,

$$ \grad \vdot \grad f = \pdv[2]{f}{x} + \pdv[2]{f}{y}.$$

Taking the divergence of the gradient corresponds to an averaging of how much
a value at a given position differs from it's neighborhood. As an example, we
can look at a non-static scalar field, with a rate of change proportional to
its' Laplacian with proportionality $\alpha$:

$$
    \pdv{\Phi}{t} = \alpha \div^2\Phi,
$$

which is the well-known heat equation, and governs diffusion of the field. It is
essentially a smoothing operation that results in every . Using heat as an
analogy, hot and cold spots diffuse throughout the field, resulting in a more
uniform distribution of the heat in the field.

\subsection*{Vector Laplacian}
\label{section:vector-laplacian}
The Laplacian can also be applied to vector (or even matrix) fields, and the
result is simply the Laplacian of each component.

Essentially, the vector Laplacian is what we have been building towards so far,
as this operator is going to be the cornerstone of the eigenfluids simulation
technique.\todo{link to section} As such, we will show some important properties
of this operator. We will return to these in later sections.\todo{link to
section}

The vector Laplacian of a vector field $\vb{f}$ is defined as

$$\underbrace{\Delta \vb{f}}_{\text{vector Laplacian}} = 
\underbrace{\grad(\div{\vb{f}})}_{\text{gradient of the divergence}} - 
\underbrace{\curl(\curl{\vb{f}})}_{\text{curl of curl = curl}^2} =
    \text{grad(div(f))} - \underbrace{\text{curl(curl(f))}}_{\text{curl}^2(f)}$$

In Cartesian coordinates, the vector Laplacian simplifies to taking the
Laplacian of each component:

\begin{equation}
    \Delta\vb{f}(x, y, z) = (\grad\vdot\grad)\vb{f} = 
    \mqty(\Delta f_1 \\ \Delta f_2 \\ \Delta f_3) =
    \mqty(
        \pdv[2]{f_1}{x} + \pdv[2]{f_1}{y} + \pdv[2]{f_1}{z}\\
        \pdv[2]{f_2}{x} + \pdv[2]{f_2}{y} + \pdv[2]{f_2}{z}\\
        \pdv[2]{f_3}{x} + \pdv[2]{f_3}{y} + \pdv[2]{f_3}{z}
    ).
\end{equation}

\todo{rá lehet mutatni, hogy a grad(div f) az tartalmazza ezeket, de m;g
a kereszt-második-deriváltakat is, amit a curl(curl f) fomrában is írhatunk, és
így igaz a fenti képlet. }

\subsection*{Differential Identities}

It can be shown that for any smooth function $\vb{u}$, 
\begin{align*}
    \numberthis
    \label{eq:diff-identity}
    \div(\curl{\vb{u}}) &\equiv 0 \\
    \curl(\grad{\vb{u}}) &\equiv 0.
\end{align*}

The idea behind the Helmholtz or Hodge decomposition is that any vector field
$\vb{u}$ can be written as the composition of a divergence-free part, and
a curl-free part. Making use of Equations~\eqref{eq:diff-identity}, we can write
the divergence-free part as the curl of something, and the curl-free part can be
written as the gradient of something else. In three dimensions,
$$\vb{u} = \curl{\boldsymbol\Psi} - \grad{p},$$

where $\boldsymbol\Psi$ is a vector-valued potential function, and $p$ is
a scalar potential function. In two dimensions, $\Psi$ is also scalar:

$$\vb{u} = \curl{\Psi} - \grad{p}.$$

This decomposition technique becomes highly relevant for incompressible fluid
flows, where we would like to make our velocity field $\vb{u}$ divergence-free
(i.e. no particles should be lost or created). Simulation techniques often
decompose an intermediate fluid field $\vb{u}^{t+1}$ into a divergence-free
part, and interpreting $p$ as the pressure that is keeping the fluid flow
divergence-free, usually throwing it away the values of $p$ immediately.

Another useful identity that will come up (\todo{Link to Eigenfluid simulation
part, where this comes up?}) later on is
$$\curl(\curl{\vb{u}}) \equiv \grad(\div{\vb{u}}) - \div{\grad{\vb{u}}}.$$
